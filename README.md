# Challenge 1:
The solution function takes an array of integers representing the number of bricks in each box. It returns the minimum number of moves needed to distribute the bricks so that each box contains exactly 10 bricks. If this distribution is not possible, the function returns -1.

# Challenge 2:
The solution function takes an array of integers and returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to the same value. If there are no such pairs, the function returns -1.

# Challenge 3:
The solution function takes an integer N and returns a string of length N containing all lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') as many times as possible, ensuring each letter occurs an equal number of times. If N is not a multiple of 26, the function returns -1.
